    "#Teacher Comment Project --- #Your task: 1. Take in a teacher spreadsheet file (teacher.csv) that contains all of the info on each student (perhaps you will need columns for student attributes, essay excerpts or grades, etc.) 2. Write a personalized comment to a separate file for each student’s name (kanye.txt,miley.txt, etc.)3. Make the teacher’s comments even better than the original! Add something of value that is not already in the teacher’s comment. What as a student would you want to see in the comments that would make them for informative to you?"
